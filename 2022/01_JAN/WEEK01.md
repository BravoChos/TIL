| CASE              | I have read the RN tutorial book occidently, and found why immutability is important in react. I knew why but I could have known earlier if I have read the tutorial right when I bought the textbook in 2019.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| WHAT I HAVE LEARN | I should be more diligent in 2022, and try to finish readng textbooks ASAP. The reason why react should keep immutability is because of the way of rendering with optimization. In react, when parent component has to update, then it's children component has to rerender. And to know when it should rerender is when there is a change in Props. Therefore, in order to compare previous object and upcoming object, we need to make sure objects that we are comparing are not the same. |
